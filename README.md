# 2020 Tokyo Olympics: USA Perfomance Analysis (Parity Mini Project)🏃🏽‍♂️🏊🏻‍♀️

## What? 💻
This project is my submission for the Parity Summer 2022 Data Analytics Internship. The repository contains my analysis of the United States Performance in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympic Games. It also contains the datasets used (all from Kaggle) and the original Rmd file. Essentially the analysis provides a summary of the top medalwinning nations in 2020, then comapres the USA to other coiuntries with similar populations and GDP, and then compares the US to its own past performances (in terms of medals won). Finally, we peer into the progression of gender equality in the Games by looking at a distribution of Female vs Male winners from 1900 to 2012.

# Why? 🤔
As I mentioned this is for the Parity Mini Project Submission for the Summer 2022 Data Analytics Internship. The project also allowed me to work on my ability in Rstudio, regain comfortability with dplyr, and challenge myself with some data cleaning!
